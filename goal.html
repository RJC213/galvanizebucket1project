                <h4>Goals</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Today I will exercise back and biceps for 45 minutes.</li>
                    <li>I will meal prep lunch for myself for tomorrow.</li>
                    <li>I will complete Drill A of "Build multi-page websites" by Wednesday.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Reflection</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Yes, I met my goal yesterday to exercise for 45 minutes. It was an achievable goal and I have set the same goal for myself for today.</li>
                    <li>I did not meal prep lunch for myself. In retrospect, I spent time that I could've used to make lunch for myself instead watching TV.</li>
                    <li>It is not Wednesday, but I have begun Drill A.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Thinking back on the goals that I set for myself:
                <br>
                My first goal is a small step in my larger goal of getting in better shape. Looking at my first goal as a piece of a much larger puzzle, successfully meeting my exercise goal for the day got me one step closer to achieving my fitness goals.
                <br>
                My second goal is also just a step in my larger goal of fueling my body with the proper nutrition and budgeting myself. Because I did not meal prep my lunch for the next day, I feel that I did not make any progress towards either of those larger goals. To counteract this, I will set aside time the night before to properly cook and store my meal so that I can continue in a positive direction.
                <br>
                My third goal, in retrospect, was not a very "timely" goal. I did end up completing both Drill A and B by Wendesday, so in that regard it was a good goal to set, but next time I will make more immediate Time goals so that at the end of my day when I reflect on the goals I set, I do not encounter another "well I started on the goal, but the time limit has not been reached yet so we'll see".

                <h4>Goals</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Today I will complete the html mockup of Project 1.</li>
                    <li>I will go to my gym, run for 15 minutes, and exercise legs.</li>
                    <li>Today I will go to the grocery store and buy food for next week.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Reflection</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>I did complete the html mockup for Project 1. 
                    Although I have not finished all the required aspects to submit Project 1, it is vital for me to do a little bit every day working towards completion of this project, and even moreso, towards any larger goal I might set.</li>
                    <li>I did go to the gym when I got home from school. 
                    Unfortunately now I'm going to be walking like a duck for the whole weekend, so, in retrospect, I should plan which muscle group I am going to work out in advance so that my soreness does not hinder my enjoyment at any events I may attend.</li>
                    <li>I went to the grocery store and bought food for the next 4 days. 
                    I realized at the grocery store that I want to eat fresh foods every day, so after 4 or 5 days the food I bought might not be good to eat. 
                    In reflecting on this goal I will in the future set goals twice a week to go to the grocery store so I always have fresh food available.</li>
