                <ol>
                    <li>What: Learning to use the Command Line</li>
                    <li>Why: So that it becomes second nature to me</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Set the Stage</h4>
                <p>I made sure to practice all of the commands we had learned every day after returning home from school. 
                After getting back home, and surfing the internet for a bit, I would set the stage. 
                I would make sure to close out of any unnecessary tabs I had open on Chrome, and double-check that I didn't have any other programs running that could distract me. 
                Once I had finished setting the stage, I would start practicing. 
                I would open up terminal and play around with what I knew: Making directories, making files, moving the files inside the directories, changing into the directories, listing the files, renaming them, changing back out of the directories, removing the directories recursively. 
                This was not the process every time, I made sure to have fun with it and try new things to expand my understanding and reinforce my knowledge.</p>
                <h4>Reflection</h4>
                <p>I'm happy with my progress in Command Line. 
                I know that I haven't even begun to scratch the surface of what it is I will eventually come to know, but I am making sure that every new thing I learn, I reinforce later that day and every time I practice I build upon what I learned previously. 
                Its like learning any new skill. It takes patience, repetition, and time to truly learn and grow.</p>

                <h3><date>May 11, 2018</date></h3>
                <h4>Topic</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>What: Practice HTML, CSS, & JavaScript</li>
                    <li>Why: To master the basic programming languages and build upon a strong foundation</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Set the Stage</h4>
                <p>Coming into Galvanize I had very little experience with these languages. 
                When it came time to do the multi-page website drills, I took it as a fantastic opportunity to practice. 
                I probably spent way too much time on superfluous things (like the See our Menu! button on drill c), but I tried and tested many things so that I would feel more comfortable in these languages. 
                I would also come home and try to make a very basic website and use lite-server to see my progress. 
                Before doing any of these things, I have to make sure that my phone is AWAY, and all of my extraneous tabs in my browser are closed. 
                I've learned through these exercises that if there's even a slight chance for me to distract myself, you can bet I'll be doing just that.</p>
                <h4>Reflection</h4>
                <p>Setting the stage for these learning exercises has become more and more crucial for me. 
                I find that if I even have one tab open to a social media page, or have my phone next to me, I am never 100% focused. 
                I will do one thing and then immediately check Facebook, or Reddit, or my text messages (even though I haven't received any). 
                At first, removing these distractions left me feeling uncomfortable, like I was going to miss out on something, but once I realized that those things weren't going anywhere, I began feeling an appreciation for the new level of focus that I am able to achieve. 
                I'm excited to continue my development with the building blocks of programming and dive in!</p>
